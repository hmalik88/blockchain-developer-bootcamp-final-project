# NFT Vickery Auction

A vickery auction is a type of sealed-bid auction. The idea behind it is to hide the bids and at the end of the auction, declare the second-highest bid as the winner. This way, the true value of an item can be derived in the auction without bid prices influencing subsequent bids. These types of auctions ensure proper price discovery and not "hype" prices.

## Workflow

1. A user can post up an NFT for sale
2. Users can bid on said NFT
3. At the end of the auction, the auctioner can call a function to transfer the funds and NFT.
